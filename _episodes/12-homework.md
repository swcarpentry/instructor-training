Today we have focused on understanding some core findings of pedagogical research about how the learning process
works and the importance of creating a positive classroom environment. We also introduced the idea of lesson study
and gave some opportunities to practice teaching. Tomorrow we will continue our discussions of
how we build teaching skill and will have more chances for practice and feedback. We will also
look in some depth at how the Carpentries operate to prepare you for the logistics of teaching a workshop.

To prepare for tomorrow, please:

1.  Read about the two types of Carpentry workshops: [self-organized][dc-self] and 
    [centrally-organized][dc-central] and the checklists
    these pages link to. These summarize commonly asked questions about organizing and running workshops.
    When you arrive tomorrow, we will ask you to add one question about our operations to a list.
    We will then do our best to answer all of those questions during the day.

2.  Prepare for the [live coding exercises]({{ page.root }}/14-live/).  Visit the lesson pages for [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/), or [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/) and choose one episode to study in preparation for several exercises during the workshops. Familiarise yourself with the content, and prepare to teach a 5 minutes-worth of content.

> ## Feedback
>
> The Trainer(s) will ask for feedback on the day in some form.  
>
> This exercise should take 5 minutes.

> ## Reflecting on the Day
>
> Before we wrap up for the day, take 5 minutes to think over
> everything we covered today.  On a piece of paper, write
> down something that captures what you want to remember about
> the day.  The Trainers won't look at this - it's just for you.  
>
> If you don't know where to start, consider
> the following list for a starting point:
>
> * draw a concept map, connecting the material
> * draw pictures or a comic depicting one of the day's concepts
> * write an outline of the topics we covered
> * write a paragraph or “journal” entry about your
> experience of the training today
> * write down one thing that struck you the most
>
> This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
